# My Tiny Blog

## Description
A simple blog application that allows user to post and view all of their blog posts. From the landing page, users are able to fill out information for their blog post and save their posts in local storage. Once the post is submitted, the user is redirected to a page which displays all of the users blog post enteries. At the top of the application, there is a theme button which allows the user to toggle between light and dark mode for the browser. However, when user is on the blog posts page, a "Back" button appears next to the theme button which allows the user to return to the landing page.
